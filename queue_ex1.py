# Design a food ordering system where your python program will run two threads,

# Place Order: This thread will be placing an order and inserting that into a queue. This thread places new order every 0.5 second. (hint: use time.sleep(0.5) function)
# Serve Order: This thread will server the order. All you need to do is pop the order out of the queue and print it. This thread serves an order every 2 seconds. Also start this thread 1 second after place order thread is started.
# orders = ['pizza','samosa','pasta','biryani','burger']
